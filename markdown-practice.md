## My Favorite Trip I Have Taken

My wife and I really enjoy getting out of our comfort zone and see all the beauty there is in other parts of the world. Not to meantion all the delicious foods to eat.

### Europe in 2018

We had been planning to go back to Europe for quite a while. We went once before for our honeymoon. On that trip we saw Paris, a couple other smaller cities in France nd ended our trip in Barcelona. It was an amazing experience. This time we were going to visit some places I had always wanted to see because that is where my family emigrated from to the US.
We spent time in a few different countries while in Europe this time around.

* Netherlands
* Italy
* Croatia

A friend of ours lives in Utrect just outside of Amsterdam and they were kind enough to let us stay with them for several days before we traveled to Italy. I think they enjoyed showing us all their favorite places for food and drinks.

Florence, Italy is probably one of the most amazingly beautiful places I have ever experienced. The architecture and the art everwhere was absolutely stunning. Around every corner was something new to experience. We only had 4 days here, but it made a lasting impression and I will definitely want to visit Italy again to see more of what it has to offer.

Next we flew into Zagreb, Croatia for the last leg of our trip, but also the longest part.

* Zagreb
* Zadar 
* Dubrovnik

Croatia feels very soviet in parts. It was part of Yugoslavia for quite a few years before all the different groups decided they needed their own countries. This is where my Greatgrand parents on my mother's side came from before the ended up in Portland. The capital city feels a bit cold and sterile, but the transit is very good. We didnt have to worry about driving anywhere. The beer there was some of the best I have had from anywhere and very much enjoyed it. From there we made our way to Zadar, which is a smaller town on the coast of the Meditteranian sea. The scenery was beautiful and we enjoyed walking through the old town area and seeing the ruins of roman columns and wells near *extremly* old churches.

## Dubrovnik

This is another place during this trip that left a lasting impression. I have never seen a city that looks so much like it came from the pages of a fantasy novel. The walled cities white walls and red roofs contrast perfectly with the azure water that laps againt said walls. We ended our trip here, but it was very difficult to leave.
